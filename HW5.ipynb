    "\n",
    "1. **Statistical Testing Concepts**:\n",
    "   - We discussed the importance of distinguishing between ideas that can be statistically examined and tested versus those that cannot.\n",
    "   - You noted that outcomes of tests refer to the population parameter rather than the sample statistic, highlighting the relevance of the sampling distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **P-Value Understanding**:\n",
    "   - We explored the concept of p-values, including their definition and what they represent in hypothesis testing.\n",
    "   - You expressed confusion about the meaning of extreme or more extreme values in the context of p-values.\n",
    "   - I clarified that a smaller p-value indicates more extreme data relative to the null hypothesis, leading to the rejection of \\( H_0 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Kissing Couples Study**:\n",
    "   - You referenced a study by Güntürkün (2003) on head tilting in kissing couples, where 80 out of 124 couples tilted their heads to the right (64.5%).\n",
    "   - We discussed simulating a p-value using a \"50/50 coin-flipping\" model under the null hypothesis that there is no head-tilt tendency.\n",
    "   - I performed the simulation in Python, which yielded a p-value of approximately **0.001**, suggesting strong evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Python Simulation Code**:\n",
    "   - I provided you with the full Python code used for the simulation, explaining each part of the code and its function in estimating the p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any more questions or if there’s anything else you’d like to discuss, feel free to ask!\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Model Building**:\n",
    "   We explored various **regression models** using **statsmodels** and **sklearn** for predicting outcomes related to social activities based on predictors like gender and relationship status. These models included OLS (ordinary least squares) regression and more complex specifications incorporating interactions between predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Challenges with Multicollinearity**:\n",
    "   A significant challenge in your models came from the issue of **multicollinearity**—particularly when adding multiple interaction terms, which caused instability in the model and led to very high **condition numbers** (e.g., `2,250,000,000,000,000`). This high condition number indicates that the predictors in the model were highly correlated, causing issues with model interpretability and making it difficult for the model to generalize well to new data (out-of-sample performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scaling and Centering**:\n",
    "   We discussed how **scaling and centering** predictor variables helps standardize them to the same scale, which should ideally improve model stability. However, interactions between scaled variables still caused multicollinearity, as highly correlated predictors made it difficult for the model to separate their individual effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Proposed Solutions**:\n",
    "   To improve model performance and stability, we suggested:\n",
    "   - **Reducing model complexity** by removing unnecessary interactions.\n",
    "   - **Checking correlations** between predictors and removing highly correlated ones.\n",
    "   - Using **regularization techniques** (like Ridge or Lasso regression) to handle multicollinearity and improve generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the discussion centered around fitting multiple regression models to your dataset, understanding multicollinearity's impact on model performance, and identifying ways to improve model stability and generalization.\n",

    "From model3_fit to model5_linear_form, the model is expanded to capture interaction terms and higher-order relationships between predictors.\n",
    "Interaction Terms: In model5_linear_form, the interactions between Attack, Defense, and Speed (and possibly other variables) are added to reflect the idea that the combined effect of two predictors on the outcome might differ from the sum of their individual effects\n",
    "The development from model5_linear_form to model6_linear_form likely involves the inclusion of additional variables or more complex interactions between existing variables.Like produce a non-linear regression\n",

    "These codes illustrate the process of evaluating and testing regression models for their ability to generalize across different subsets of the data. By focusing on Pokémon generations, the analysis checks whether models trained on one group of datacan predict outcomes  for unseen data. The in-sample R-squared values show how well the model fits the training data, while the out-of-sample R-squared values assess the model’s generalizability. The results help understand whether the model is overfitting to specific generations or whether it can predict across different datasets effectively."
